# social-network-animation
Created for CS4/5740 at UCCS; contains several Python functions for creating animations of data that is contained in square grids.

The module `animate_schelling.py` contains several useful functions:

- `create_example()` generates dummy data for an animation; use this to test your setup and to see what format the data needs to be in. This can also dump animation data to disk in JSON format. The dummy animation created looks like this: ![dummy animation](https://media.giphy.com/media/lh7cq7nmYLMYvDAB1I/giphy.gif)
- `load_json_file()` loads a pre-generated JSON file with animation data and prepares it for use in animation.
- `display_animation()` actually creates the animation. This can also generate an animated GIF and save it to disk.

Each function has documentation in `animate_schelling.py`, and usage examples in both `usage_example.py` and if you like Jupyter Notebooks, in `Usage Example Notebook.ipynb`.
